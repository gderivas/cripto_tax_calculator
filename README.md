# Cripto Tax Calculator (BETA!)

Criptocurrencies Profit/Losses Calculator for the following plattforms:

- Kraken
- Coinbase

Calculates profit/loss for buy/sell (FIFO) of criptocurrencies and stake/earn profits. It also takes into account the difference in price of the earn profits and the sell orders.

## LOP

- Select file for loading historical pricing data in args
- Calculate taxes based on profit
- Load list of id's to exclude from calculation

## Flaws (In future in LOP)

- Only EUR
- Only FIATvsCripto trades are taken into account (Not trades between different criptocurrencies)
